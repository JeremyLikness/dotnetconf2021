# .NET Conf 2021 Demos

This repo contains the source code and presentations related to what's new in EF Core 6 and using EF Core 6 with GraphQL. I'm sharing these under an MIT license so that you can repurpose them for your own presentations. These are offered "as is" but I'm happy to answer questions via [Issues](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/dotNetConf2021/issues) here on GitHub, or through my open direct messages (DMs) on Twitter: [@JeremyLikness](https://twitter.com/JeremyLikness).
